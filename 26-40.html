         <p>Those post-pub curries are becoming harder to shift. Although you can still build some serious muscle in your thirties,
            a 1% drop in testosterone per year means it's likely you'll have to think about changing your workout
            and boosting your metabolism to get rid of fat that's starting to become more stubborn, according to Lerwill.
         </p>
         <p>
            You're in good company. In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, scientists found that
            men who managed to maintain their weight for 40 years still gained 3 pounds of fat each decade,
            while losing 3 pounds of muscle. In other words, father time's besting your body in the muscle and fat negotiations.
         </p> 
         <p>
            A six-pack is still possible, but you'll have to dedicate more time to fighting the flab it's hiding under.
            “By combining smart dieting with the right training there is no reason for having any fat covering your abs after 
            three months of dedication,” says PT Coel Fulton. Just channel your inner Chris Hemsworth: watch the calories and 
            do more high intensity interval training that will see you burn off the fat and build muscle at the same time.
         </p> 
         <p> 
            We can guarantee that more intense workouts will also keep your cardiovascular fitness in check. According to a 
            study published in The Journal of Physiology, your VO2 max (your body's ability to use oxygen) declines by 10% per 
            decade after the age of 30. But men who continue to compete and train hard can reduce this drop by about half,
            meaning you'll still be able to exercise harder for longer periods. And increase your life expectancy.
         </p> 
         <p>
            You're also at the time of your life where starring in your own little episode of Who Do You Think You Are? 
            could become vital for your training. Speaking to your family could identify where your genetic weaknesses might be,
            from type II diabetes to strokes or heart attacks. “Do that and it's possible to work out where you need to concentrate,”
            says Lerwill. Motivation to hit the squat rack is easier to find when you know it's keeping you not just trim, but alive.
