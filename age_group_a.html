         <h2 class="title">This is why you are ready</h2>
         <p>Good news, in its third decade you body is primed for power sports and large muscle growth. 
            Give yourself a pat on your potentially rippling back.
         </p>
         <p>
            Right now you're packing more testosterone than a bull in heat, so take advantage with heavy metal.
            According to PT Sean Lerwill, the hormone's responsible for strength gains (not to mention an aesthetic win)
            by inducing your body to build muscle and burn blubber. So swerve the cross trainer and head straight to the weights room
            to take advantage of a body primed for visible abs.
         </p>
         <p>
            But it's not just hormones cheering you on; your body composition is geared towards more gains with less work. 
            Swedish research found your youthful physique is crammed with more type II muscles (the so-called “fast-twitch” fibres)
            deployed for power, as opposed to the smaller type I muscles suited to endurance. So instead of steady state, 
            switch your cardio to high intensity training during your twenties to incinerate fat and avoid a premature paunch.
         </p>
         <p>
            As with your pension, investing in your body early means a later life payoff. 
            Although it's muscle memory you've got to thank, rather than your bank manager.
            That's because recent research has indicated that once you've built the nuclei that turn protein into muscle,
            they hang around. And now's your prime for laying the foundations to ensure you're maintaining in a decade,
            not struggling from scratch. Otherwise you'll be (weakly) kicking yourself as the big 40 rears its grey head.
