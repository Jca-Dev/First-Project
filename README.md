    </li>

   <li>Footer wasn't floating at the bottom of the page.
    changed postion from absoloute to fixed.</li>

   <li>Background image wasn't central to the page. Removed "background-position: unset;" and for contact.html changed from unset to right.</li>

   <li>Text padding didn't fit well in desktop and mobile variations. removed css ul and p and created a seperate classes for affected text then modified the padding values checking with chrome developer tools</li>
