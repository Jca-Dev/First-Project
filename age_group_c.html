            You're on the wane after 40, right? Ask 43-year-old Valmir Nunes,
            who completed the fastest ever time of the Badwater ultra-marathon, a 135-mile course in 50 degree heat across Death Valley.
            As he knows, greying hair comes with a side order of stamina.

            According to scientists to from the University of Texas Medical Branch, 
            though those fast-twitch fibres start to decline past 40, your slow-twitch fibres, 
            the ones most associated with endurance racing, are less affected. The performance of weightlifters drops like an overloaded 
            barbell after 40, but endurance athletes, such as rowers, see their performance fade more slowly, 
            according to a study published in Experimental Aging Research. So keep yourself shipshape with these rowing machine workouts.

            In an interview with Men's Health US, Jeff Cavaliere, C.S.C.S. says that mind-muscle connection is paramount when it 
            comes to building muscle at forty-plus. Controlled reps and movement patterns are key here, building a solid foundation
            for strength. Lighter weights have their place here, too â€” especially when used in high-rep metabolic training.
            The lighter weights will leave you less sore and help you recover quicker.

            But what about our four-time cover star Jason Statham? He should thanks his parents for genetics that pay little heed to 
            the sands of time. But whether your DNA's for you or against, honing your training to your age is the simple way to make
            every stage of your life your peak years.
